Mongoid::Paperclip - Making Paperclip play nice with Mongoid ODM
================================================================

As the title suggests: `Mongoid::Paperclip` makes it easy to hook up [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) with [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/).

This is actually easier and faster to set up than when using Paperclip and the ActiveRecord ORM.
This example assumes you are using **Ruby on Rails 3** and **Bundler**. However it doesn't require either.


Setting it up
-------------

Simply define the `mongoid-paperclip` gem inside your `Gemfile`. Additionally, you can define the `aws-s3` gem if you want to upload your files to Amazon S3. *You do not need to explicitly define the `paperclip` gem itself, since this is handled by `mongoid-paperclip`.*

**Rails.root/Gemfile - Just define the following:**

    gem "mongoid-paperclip", :require => "mongoid_paperclip"
    gem "aws-s3",            :require => "aws/s3"

Next let's assume we have a User model and we want to allow our users to upload an avatar.

**Rails.root/app/models/user.rb - include the Mongoid::Paperclip module and invoke the provided class method**

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Paperclip

      has_mongoid_attached_file :avatar
    end


That's it
--------

That's all you have to do. Users can now upload avatars. Unlike ActiveRecord, Mongoid doesn't use migrations, so we don't need to define the Paperclip columns in a separate file. Invoking the `has_mongoid_attached_file` method will automatically define the necessary `:avatar` fields for you in the background.


A more complex example
----------------------

Just like Paperclip, Mongoid::Paperclip takes a second argument (hash of options) for the `has_mongoid_attached_file` method, so you can do more complex things such as in the following example.

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      embeds_many :pictures
    end

    class Picture
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Paperclip

      embedded_in :user, :inverse_of => :pictures

      has_mongoid_attached_file :attachment,
        :path           => ':attachment/:id/:style.:extension',
        :storage        => :s3,
        :url            => ':s3_alias_url',
        :s3_host_alias  => 'something.cloudfront.net',
        :s3_credentials => File.join(Rails.root, 'config', 's3.yml'),
        :styles => {
          :original => ['1920x1680>', :jpg],
          :small    => ['100x100#',   :jpg],
          :medium   => ['250x250',    :jpg],
          :large    => ['500x500>',   :jpg]
        },
        :convert_options => { :all => '-background white -flatten +matte' }
    end

    @user.pictures.each do |picture|
      <%= picture.attachment.url %>
    end

Note on embedded documents: if you plan to save or update the parent document, you MUST add cascade_callbacks: true to your
embeds_XXX statement.  Otherwise, your data will be updated but the paperclip functions will not run to copy/update your file.

In the above example:

```ruby
    class User
    ...
    embeds_many :pictures, :cascade_callbacks => true
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :pictures, ...
    attr_accepted :pictures_attributes, ...
    ...
    end

    @user.update_attributes({ ... :pictures => [...] })
```


There you go
------------

Quite a lot of people have been looking for a solution to use Paperclip with Mongoid so I hope this helps!

If you need more information on either [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/) or [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) I suggest checking our their official documentation and website.
